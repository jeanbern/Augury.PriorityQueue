# High Speed Priority Queue for C&#35;

Modified for use by Jean-Bernard Pellerin

### Features ###
* Faster (for path-finding, at least) than any other C# priority queue out there!
* Easy to use
* No dependencies on third-party libraries
* Free for both personal and commercial use
* Implements `IEnumerable<T>` for LINQ support!
* Takes advantage of the new [forced inline support](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.compilerservices.methodimploptions%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) when compiling under .Net 4.5, for even faster speeds
* Should work on .Net versions as old as .Net 2.0
